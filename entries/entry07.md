This is the end-! I was able to create a series of code that allows the game to detect if the player was touching something. Which is able to stop the player from jumping infinitly. 
In addition to such accomplishments, I also tweaked the controls to fit with the new code, and modified the speed of the player.

I also tweaked the stage to use a bug of Matter.js to it's advantage, creating something like a elevator in 2D.
