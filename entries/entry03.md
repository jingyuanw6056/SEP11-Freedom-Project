To start this off, I watched a part of this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urR596FsU68) and followed [this](https://github.com/liabru/matter-js/wiki/Getting-started).
With both resources availble, and following the video, I created something similar to the example the first half of video presented, except I used the Matter.Js's Render

This helped me learn the very basics for the engine, which I now know how to create and add basic shapes in a world to stimulate with the engine
This also bring me to about the certian properties, and possible issues when in contact with it if not handled correctly

I used "How to Google", "Growth mindset", and "How to read", I searched up the video on google in order to learn and get example of what I, then I followed the getting started page for the engine to build my personal test of the engine
