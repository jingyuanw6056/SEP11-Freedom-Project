After a long time, player movement have been settled and dealt with. It turns out that I am able to use normal javascript with matter.js at the same time to accomplish what I needed to do. Which is really good

But another problem emerage as soon I finished the controls, I had set W to jump. But player can keep pressing W repeatedly to jump infinite amount of times.
So i thought of something that will detect whether or not the player is touching the ground or not. I will do that another day.

Today I used "How to Google", "Problem decomposition", and "Time management". Because I progress with my MVP, by googling up that I am able to use normal javascript with my tool. And break down my problem of infinite jumps by setting up a potential solution
