First, I have decided on using [Matter.Js](https://brm.io/matter-js/) for my Freedom project

Matter JS is a rather simple 2D engine that will fit my needs to create a simple and probably infinite shooter game, or something simple
like [such](https://dev.to/oohsinan/creating-a-flappy-bird-clone-with-p5-js-and-matter-js-22de)

Things like values, functions, if else conditions are heavily used and explained in class

I met a problem when thinking with examples made by the devs who created the engine, 
which is that I learned that Matter.Js have a problem with it's hit boxes... since ermm... if things goes very fast, they can go pass stuff
I originally thinks it will be an annoying thing to deal with since, but the I think of making the objects bigger so they can't be passed easily,
setting up a speed cap and such, which works, but still need to be modified to avoid breakage of program. 

[Example, just... throw the boxes really hard](https://brm.io/matter-js/demo/#airFriction)


I used "How to Google" and "Attention to detail", I searched up these examples to mess with them, and then notice a few bugs along the way.
